                Prototyping lets architects and teams explore high-risk ideas in
                isolation, building quick throw-away spikes to validate concepts
                without polluting the main codebase. Early feedback loops reveal
                technical or business pitfalls, so decisions rest on real data
                rather than assumption. By separating experimental code into
                disposable branches or sandbox environments, you preserve
                production integrity and avoid accruing long-term debt. When a
                prototype succeeds, its learnings guide a clean, well-structured
                implementation; when it fails, you discard or pivot without
                fear. This practice accelerates innovation while safeguarding
                stability, ensuring that only validated patterns merge into the
                core architecture.

                <strong>The Prototype</strong> — As a Major Arcana embodiment of
                experimentation, this card reminds architects that even small
                experiments shape strategic direction. When drawn alongside I of
                Change, it urges you to treat prototypes as first-class
                artifacts: document learnings, measure against objectives, and
                align quickly before investing deeper.

                <strong>The Vision</strong> — This Major Arcana highlights the
                importance of connecting every prototype to a larger roadmap. It
                prompts you to ask: Does this spike advance our north-star
                goals, or is it a distracting diversion? By referencing The
                Vision, you ensure rapid experiments remain tied to strategic
                alignment and shared purpose.
