                Sunsetting marks the end-of-life process for components that no
                longer deliver value or align with strategic goals. The
                architect oversees planning deprecation timelines, migrating
                data, and communicating with stakeholders to minimize
                disruption. Establishing clear cutoffs, archiving documentation,
                and automating decommissioning scripts ensures resources are
                freed responsibly. Metrics on usage patterns guide decisions,
                and rollback plans safeguard against unexpected fallout. Proper
                sunsetting preserves system hygiene, reduces maintenance
                overhead, and opens capacity for innovation. Involving
                cross-functional teams early avoids hidden dependencies and
                legal pitfalls. Ultimately, graceful sunsets reflect disciplined
                governance and respect for user impact, ensuring the
                organization retires obsolete assets with confidence and
                clarity.

                <strong>The Phoenix</strong> — The Phoenix calls for architects
                to see the sunset card as a prelude to rebirth, reminding us
                that deprecating a service opens space for innovative designs.
                Even as old components fade, we must document lessons learned
                and plan for a transformed, resilient system that rises anew.

                <strong>The Migration</strong> — The Migration highlights that
                sunsetting is not just an endpoint but a passage. Architects
                should consider data transfers, user migrations, and
                compatibility wrappers when retiring features. A well-executed
                migration plan minimizes downtime and ensures users transition
                smoothly, preserving trust as old services bow out gracefully.
