                Estimation is about breaking down complex features into
                bite‐sized increments that can be compared to past work and
                adjusted as risks surface. You create ranged forecasts—best‐,
                likely‐, and worst‐case scenarios—to set realistic expectations
                and accommodate uncertainty. By continuously refining estimates
                against actuals, you maintain trust with stakeholders while
                preserving the flexibility to pivot. Visible tracking of
                delivered scope against original projections sharpens your
                understanding of hidden assumptions and highlights areas where
                unknowns must be reduced. Ultimately, good estimation fosters a
                culture where teams commit confidently and adjust course based
                on measurable feedback loops.

                <strong>VI The Roadmap</strong> — This card underscores that
                accurate estimation underpins effective sequencing. As you plot
                milestones and capacity, forecasting becomes a living artifact;
                emerging risks force you to revisit estimates and reorder
                dependencies. Roadmap clarity emerges when estimation drives
                realistic deliverables rather than aspirational targets.

                <strong>X The Debt</strong> — When hidden technical trade‐offs
                and shortcuts accumulate, estimates balloon unpredictably. Debt
                reminds you to factor legacy burdens into sizing exercises.
                Recognizing accumulated compromises helps you adjust
                forecasts—allocating extra buffer for pay‐down work—and prevents
                unforeseen overruns from blindsiding the roadmap.
