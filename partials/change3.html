                Planning orchestrates sequencing of tasks, aligning capacity,
                risk, and dependencies to turn vision into reality. The
                architect decomposes high-level goals into milestones, mapping
                out critical paths and resource constraints. By keeping plans
                living documents—regularly updated with feedback and changing
                assumptions—the team preserves flexibility while maintaining
                stakeholder trust. Effective planning surfaces hidden
                dependencies between teams and technologies early, allowing
                proactive mitigation of bottlenecks. Clear planning reduces
                optimism bias, setting realistic timelines and measurable
                checkpoints. Architects facilitate plan reviews, injecting
                technical context into roadmap discussions to ensure sustainable
                delivery, balancing near-term wins with long-term architectural
                health. Ultimately, robust planning guides iterative progress
                without calcifying assumptions or neglecting emergent risks.

                <strong>VI The Roadmap</strong> — As the architect aligns
                sequencing, the Roadmap card underscores structuring
                interdependent tasks into clear phases. It reminds you to
                revisit assumptions when variables shift, ensuring that
                milestone planning adapts to technological or stakeholder
                changes without breaking the overarching timeline.

                <strong>IX The ADR</strong> — This card highlights the
                importance of recording architectural choices and their
                rationale. Under Planning, ADR ensures that all decision
                points—trade-offs, alternatives, and risks—are captured,
                providing context for future course corrections and enabling
                transparent reviews as the project unfolds.
