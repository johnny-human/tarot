                As demand grows, you architect for horizontal expansion—breaking
                services into stateless components, sharding data stores, and
                enabling autoscaling groups. Observability guides each step:
                metrics reveal bottlenecks so you can incrementally add capacity
                or refactor hotspots. By planning for elasticity early, you
                avoid costly rewrites and ensure resilience under load,
                balancing performance, cost, and complexity as the system
                evolves.

                <strong>VI The Roadmap</strong> — When planning scaling phases,
                the Roadmap clarifies dependency order and resource allocation.
                It ensures you sequence infrastructure upgrades before traffic
                spikes, aligning teams on timelines and preventing surprises
                when capacity must grow.

                <strong>XVIII The Risk</strong> — Scaling introduces new failure
                modes: untested shards, autoscaling misconfigurations, or
                cascading cache misses. The Risk card reminds you to
                threat-model these scenarios, set SLOs for new components, and
                build fallback paths before traffic peaks expose weaknesses.
