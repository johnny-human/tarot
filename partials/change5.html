                Legacy Entanglement highlights the invisible knots formed over
                years of quick fixes, outdated frameworks, and untracked
                dependencies. An architect should map these seams, write
                characterization tests to understand hidden behaviors, and
                choose a strangler pattern rather than a big-bang rewrite. By
                isolating legacy components behind clear interfaces, teams can
                incrementally decouple without disrupting ongoing feature work.
                This principle encourages thoughtful planning for
                refactoring—balancing risk, cost, and continuity—so that
                stability is maintained while technical debt is gradually paid
                down. The ultimate goal is a clear path forward that prevents
                brittle entanglement from grinding future innovation to a halt.

                <strong>The Legacy</strong> — This card underscores the weight
                of inherited systems; its presence forces reflection on why
                certain complexities persist. It reminds architects to balance
                respect for stability with courage to challenge inertia,
                ensuring that valuable history isn’t preserved at the cost of
                future agility.

                <strong>The Migration</strong> — When migration appears
                alongside Legacy Entanglement, it signals the necessity of
                carefully planned movement. It encourages architects to
                choreograph incremental transformations—moving data, APIs, or
                entire modules step by step—so that modernisation occurs without
                catastrophic downtime or loss of institutional knowledge.
