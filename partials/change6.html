            <p><strong>Theme (quick cue):</strong><br> Accumulated trade-offs,
                invisible burdens</p>

            <p>
                Tech debt arises when teams trade long-term maintainability for
                short-term delivery. An architect must catalogue these
                compromises in a visible backlog, allocate budget for gradual
                pay-down, and measure “interest” as slowed lead time. Without
                vigilance, undocumented hacks and design shortcuts compound into
                cryptic code paths that impede future features, inflate defect
                rates, and frustrate onboarding. By treating debt like a balance
                sheet—tracking its principal, estimating payoff effort, and
                scheduling continuous refactors—the architect ensures debt
                remains a strategic lever rather than a hidden drag on velocity
                and quality.

                <strong>X · The Debt</strong> — As the Major Arcana embodiment
                of cumulative burdens, The Debt card warns when hidden
                trade-offs have become systemic. When Tech Debt appears below
                it, architects confront not only code smells but the deeper
                cultural acceptance of shortcuts—inviting a disciplined payoff
                plan before collapse.

                <strong>XVI · The Refactor</strong> — In tandem with Tech Debt,
                The Refactor major urges continuous, incremental improvement. It
                reminds architects that paying down debt isn’t a one-off crusade
                but a rhythmic practice: small, safe code surgeries that restore
                integrity and prevent future accrual of hidden costs.
