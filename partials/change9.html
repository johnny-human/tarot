                The Release Train establishes a steady rhythm for delivering
                features and fixes. By grouping work into regular, time-boxed
                “trains,” teams reduce release anxiety and coordinate
                cross-functional dependencies. Predictable departure dates force
                rigor in testing, documentation, and stakeholder sign-off. Over
                time, this cadence becomes a feedback loop—each train’s
                retrospective refines boarding criteria, improves automation,
                and smooths handoffs. The discipline of riding the train builds
                trust across engineering, QA, and business units, so releases
                feel less like rollouts and more like celebrated milestones.
                When train frequency aligns with team capacity, risk falls:
                smaller batches mean faster rollback if something goes off the
                rails.

                <strong>The Roadmap</strong> — By mapping dependencies and
                milestones, The Roadmap clarifies which features board each
                upcoming train. Its guidance ensures that every engineer knows
                where the line should stop before the next departure, preventing
                scope creep from delaying schedules.

                <strong>The Pipeline</strong> — The Pipeline fuels each train
                with automated builds, tests, and deployments. When CI/CD gates
                are strong, train engineers trust that their wagon won’t derail
                mid-journey, keeping velocity high and surprises low.
