                Fast, trustworthy feedback loops are the circulatory system of
                any healthy software effort. They convert uncertainty into
                knowledge by shrinking the gap between action and insight.
                Whether triggered by unit tests, canary metrics, or
                retrospective surveys, each loop tells the team what reality
                thinks of its latest idea. Short loops encourage frequent,
                reversible changes; long loops breed guesswork and risk.
                Architects nurture speed with automation, telemetry, and clear
                acceptance criteria, but also by shaping sociotechnical
                culture—celebrating early failure and shared learning. The card
                asks: what signal arrives too late, and what small change could
                cut that distance in half right now?

                <strong>XIX The Pipeline</strong> — When this card meets The
                Pipeline, it highlights the mechanical heart pumping those
                signals. A robust pipeline multiplies every feedback loop’s
                reach, turning code commits into instant verdicts. If the loop
                feels sluggish, the Pipeline urges investment in automation,
                caching, and parallel execution.

                <strong>III The Prototype</strong> — The Prototype focuses on
                experimentation; paired with Feedback Loops it asks how quickly
                you can prove or kill an idea. Rapid loops shorten a prototype’s
                lifespan, conserving effort. If experiments linger unanswered,
                the Prototype demands sharper hypotheses and more discriminating
                metrics.
