                Shared Understanding represents the collective mental model that
                lets a diverse engineering organisation move like one organism.
                It emerges from clear domain language, up-to-date diagrams, and
                bi-directional feedback loops that synchronise tacit and
                explicit knowledge. When everyone can predict how a change
                ripples through the system, collaboration friction drops and
                architectural quality stays visible. As architect, you cultivate
                this clarity by hosting mapping workshops, embedding
                documentation into code, and rotating pair-programming across
                teams. The goal is not unanimous agreement on every detail but a
                shared compass about behaviours, constraints, and trade-offs so
                teams can act autonomously without drifting apart. Refresh it
                regularly, or tribal divergence soon creeps in and silos harden.

                <strong>The Stakeholder</strong> — The Stakeholder card reminds
                us that shared understanding only sticks when every voice feels
                heard. Invite business, design, and operations into architecture
                diagrams; translate latency, cost, and risk into language they
                own. Their buy-in turns abstract models into funded, protected
                reality.

                <strong>The Documentation</strong> — The Documentation card
                highlights the written backbone of collective knowledge. Inline
                ADR links, living API specs, and searchable runbooks ensure the
                model survives turnover and timezones. Without these artifacts,
                shared understanding fades to folklore and decisions must be
                re-earned at great cost.
