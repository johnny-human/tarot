            <p>
                Daily stand-ups act as the team’s heartbeat, synchronising
                intent, revealing blockers, and calibrating priorities in under
                fifteen minutes. By surfacing micro-adjustments early they
                prevent cascading rework, shorten feedback loops, and maintain
                shared mental models across architecture layers. Effective
                stand-ups are agenda-light but outcome-rich: each voice reports
                progress toward the sprint goal, flags impediments, and requests
                targeted help. The architect listens for systemic
                patterns—repeated blockers, unclear boundaries, emerging
                debt—and converts them into backlog items or design workshops.
                When consistently practiced, stand-ups keep flow smooth,
                minimise surprise integration conflicts, and sustain
                psychological safety, because nothing festers unspoken longer
                than twenty-four hours, for any healthy agile architecture.

                <strong>The Stakeholder</strong> — This card reminds the
                facilitator that every stand-up is partly a negotiation. Like a
                miniature stakeholder review, the circle verifies that
                yesterday’s assumptions still serve today’s value. When voices
                diverge, pull the discussion offline but record the misalignment
                as work to reconcile before scope drifts.

                <strong>The Pipeline</strong> — Automated delivery thrives when
                stand-ups expose failing builds or stuck reviews early. Treat
                the pipeline as an invisible attendee: its status deserves a
                daily voice. Celebrating green flows and diagnosing red ones in
                real time reinforces the team’s commitment to flow and quality.
