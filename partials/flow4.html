                Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) capture context, options,
                decisions, and consequences for every significant technical
                choice. Embedding ADR writing in the development cadence
                preserves architectural intent, shortens onboarding, and halts
                endless rediscovery debates. Each concise, linkable document
                forms part of a living engineering journal that evolves
                alongside code, remaining searchable and reviewable. When
                assumptions shift, revisiting ADRs flags design drift early,
                guiding timely refactoring before small mismatches snowball into
                systemic risk. By externalising rationale, ADRs satisfy auditors
                and future maintainers alike, converting tribal knowledge into
                durable organisational memory.

                <strong>IX The ADR</strong> — IX The ADR magnifies this minor’s
                impulse: it urges the architect to foreground clarity over
                chaos, recording not only what was chosen but why rejected paths
                were declined. When both appear, they spotlight missing
                rationale that threatens alignment and invite disciplined
                record-keeping.

                <strong>XX The Documentation</strong> — XX The Documentation
                complements ADR’s snapshot by ensuring decisions remain
                discoverable amid sprawling knowledge bases. It asks whether
                your ADR index is searchable, versioned, and woven into
                onboarding material, turning isolated decision files into a
                coherent map for every new contributor.
