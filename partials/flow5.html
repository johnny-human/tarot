                Decision fatigue drains creative energy when every step demands
                a choice—from framework versions to logging formats and
                deployment flags. The architect counters by establishing
                paved-road defaults, enforcing style guides, and pruning
                outdated options. Clear standards concentrate thought on
                business problems instead of plumbing decisions. Rotating
                retrospectives expose where choice overload still sneaks in,
                while automated scaffolding encodes the agreed conventions.
                Metrics such as pull-request churn and onboard-time track
                whether the cognitive tax is falling. By guarding the team’s
                limited decision budget, the architect preserves momentum,
                reduces inconsistency, and leaves engineers fresher for truly
                novel challenges. Documenting these norms in living ADRs keeps
                context close.

                <strong>The Vision</strong> — The Vision reminds the team that
                every default exists to serve a bigger purpose, not to stifle
                ingenuity. When alignment on north-star outcomes is strong,
                architects can safely narrow technical choices without fear of
                quashing creativity or alienating passionate specialists.

                <strong>The Governance</strong> — Governance sets bright rails
                that shield cognitive bandwidth while preserving freedom inside
                the track. By articulating mandatory standards, escalation
                paths, and sunset schedules, it frees engineers from endless
                debate over tooling minutiae and ensures scarce decision power
                is spent where it truly matters.
