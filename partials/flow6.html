                Stakeholder Sync is the architect’s steady heartbeat for
                clarity. Through regular demos, roadmap check-ins, and KPI
                reviews, you translate latency, backlog, and risk into cost,
                value, and timeline. By surfacing trade-offs early, the ritual
                prevents scope creep, last-minute escalations, and political
                surprises. A shared glossary, concise status decks, and
                empowered representatives keep debates on outcomes rather than
                implementation minutiae. Done well, the meeting becomes a
                trust-battery: business feels heard, engineers feel unblocked,
                and priorities remain explicit. Done poorly, it decays into
                status theatre or silence, letting assumptions diverge until
                projects stall. The goal is rhythm, transparency, and one
                continuous narrative everyone can repeat.

                <strong>V The Vision</strong> — This card reminds the group to
                keep the “north-star” visible in every sync. Ask: does today’s
                discussion move us closer to the promised future, or are we
                orbiting noise? Re-align the agenda until every update traces
                back to that beacon.

                <strong>VIII The Stakeholder</strong> — Here, the archetype
                steps off the major track and into the meeting room, urging fair
                negotiation and shared language. If tensions rise, invoke this
                card to pause, restate goals in plain business terms, and
                rebuild common ground before decisions harden.
