            <p><strong>Theme (quick cue):</strong><br> Harnessing tension for
                progress</p>
        </div>

        <div class="principle">
            <p>
                Architects frequently sit between feuding priorities—performance
                versus scope, time-to-market
                versus robustness, team A’s roadmap versus team B’s refactor.
                This card reminds us that
                healthy conflict, when channelled, exposes hidden assumptions
                and sharpens design. The
                practice is deliberate: surface dissent early, frame discussions
                around shared goals,
                separate people from problems, and record decisions so debate
                does not rewind. Genuine
                resolution produces clearer boundaries, tighter interfaces, and
                renewed trust; avoidance
                breeds shadow work and brittle compromises. Treat disagreement
                as diagnostic data, not a
                threat, and guided tension becomes a forge where better
                architecture is hammered out.

                <strong>VIII The Stakeholder</strong> — When this major appears
                beside Conflict
                Resolution, it urges the architect to translate technical
                dispute into shared business
                language. By naming the real interests at the table, you
                transform opponents into partners
                seeking a mutually visible win, not just a louder microphone.

                <strong>XI The Disruption</strong> — Pairing with Conflict
                Resolution, The Disruption
                warns that smouldering friction can burst into innovation or
                chaos. Lean in: facilitate a
                safe “storming” phase, let bold ideas clash, and harvest the
                resulting creative sparks
                before they scorch delivery timelines.
