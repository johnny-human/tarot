            <p><strong>Theme (quick cue):</strong><br> Out-of-date knowledge
                slows everyone down</p>
        </div>

        <div class="principle">
            <p>
                Documentation Debt accumulates when code, diagrams, and runbooks
                drift out of sync with reality. Teams rely on tribal knowledge,
                onboarding drags, and critical context is lost during incidents.
                Like technical debt, the cost compounds: every change now takes
                longer to understand, validate, and review. Unclear ownership,
                missing templates, and tight deadlines drive this erosion.
                Architects must treat docs as living artefacts, integrating them
                into pipelines, pairing edits with code changes, and automating
                visibility checks. Paying down the debt restores shared
                understanding, accelerates decision making, safeguards system
                resilience, and boosts audit readiness, supporting remote
                collaboration while preserving architectural intent for future
                generations.

                <strong>XX The Documentation</strong> — XX The Documentation
                reminds us that living knowledge is a product, not an
                afterthought. When this major appears beside Documentation Debt
                it urges the architect to embed docs-as-code into CI, promote
                shared glossaries, and reward contributors who keep context
                fresh and searchable.

                <strong>XIII The Governance</strong> — XIII The Governance pairs
                with Documentation Debt to warn of hidden compliance risk. It
                invites the architect to set standards for authoring, review
                cycles, and retention; without these guardrails, knowledge leaks
                silently and audits become ordeals rather than routine
                checkpoints of architectural discipline.
