                As the Architect, you hold the coherent
                blueprint that aligns purpose,
                constraints, and technology into a
                balanced whole. You see across layers,
                recognise trade-offs, and translate
                fuzzy goals into concrete structures
                that can be evolved safely. Your role is
                both visionary and pragmatic: you frame
                the north-star, establish non-negotiable
                quality attributes, and mediate between
                competing voices. By visualising systems
                as living organisms, you reveal hidden
                couplings, enable modular growth, and
                guard the integrity of intent from
                ideation through operation. The
                Architect reminds teams that clarity is
                a force multiplier, and every decision
                echoes throughout the entire ecosystem,
                promoting shared understanding and
                disciplined execution.

                Structure (Earth) — Define clear
                modules, interfaces, and layering;
                enforce coding standards and diagrams so
                that complexity remains visible and
                negotiable. A well-grounded structure
                embodies the Architect’s philosophy:
                make intent explicit so change never
                corrodes the core design.

                Flow (Water) — Architectural clarity
                streamlines conversations: stand-ups
                focus on outcomes, ADRs capture
                rationale, and feedback loops stay
                tight. When everyone pictures the same
                map, collaboration flows smoothly,
                reducing meeting friction and
                accelerating collective decision-making.

                Risk (Fire) — A coherent architecture
                hardens defence: known boundaries define
                attack surfaces, layered
                responsibilities limit blast radius, and
                dependable logging threads across
                components. By eliminating ambiguity,
                the Architect lowers uncertainty and
                turns potential fire into manageable
                risk.

                Change (Air) — Because the blueprint is
                clear, evolution becomes deliberate:
                feature flags, refactors, and migrations
                follow a visible plan rather than
                emergency reactions. The Architect
                channels air, guiding continual
                improvement without sacrificing the
                stability hard-won in stone.
