                Movement, transformation, evolution</p>

            <p>
                The Migration heralds the deliberate journey from one
                technological state to another, whether lifting code into
                containers, splitting a monolith, or swapping databases. It
                teaches architects to balance continuity with transformation,
                honouring existing value while unlocking new capabilities.
                Successful migration respects business cadence, tests each
                incremental step, and preserves experiential knowledge through
                documentation and automation. The card reminds us that change is
                rarely instantaneous; instead, it is a series of negotiable
                contracts, reversible checkpoints, and learning loops that
                collectively redefine the system's identity while safeguarding
                user trust and operational stability. It finally celebrates the
                momentum gained once inertia is broken, revealing architecture
                as a living organism forever geared toward better service.

                Structure (Earth) — Begin by mapping current domain boundaries
                to their future homes; refactor seams, embed anti-corruption
                layers, and prove each slice with contract tests so the
                structural integrity of both old and new remains observable.

                Flow (Water) — Synchronise squads through migration ceremonies,
                demo checkpoints, and living roadmaps; celebrate every retired
                endpoint to maintain morale, and keep feedback loops tight so
                communication currents guide course corrections before small
                drifts become expensive detours.

                Risk (Fire) — Model parallel-run exposure, quantify rollback
                windows, and guard data integrity with dual-write safeguards;
                practice chaos tests under load to reveal hidden blast radii,
                ensuring the path of fire is contained before business
                reputation ignites.

                Change (Air) — Embrace evolutionary delivery: release feature
                flags, incremental data backfills, and canary workloads,
                allowing the system to breathe new air continuously; each
                controlled puff diffuses anxiety and proves that migration is
                momentum, not upheaval.
