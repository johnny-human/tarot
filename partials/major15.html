            <p>
                An outage is the sharp reminder that software lives in a
                volatile world where assumptions meet reality. It collapses
                layers of abstraction, exposing dependencies, load patterns, and
                organisational reflexes in a single, urgent moment. The Outage
                card asks the architect to consider resilience before glamour,
                to architect for graceful degradation, to invest in
                observability and rehearsed recovery drills, and to foster a
                blameless culture that turns pain into insight. It embodies the
                truth that reliability is a feature, not an after-thought, and
                that real learning often arrives on the wings of interruption.
                Each disruption exposes hidden social contracts and forces the
                architecture to declare its true priorities.

                Structure (Earth) — Failure modes must be drawn on the
                blueprint: redundant nodes, circuit breakers, and clear layer
                boundaries. The Outage teaches Earth architects that sturdiness
                grows from intentional seams, not heroic patches added under
                smoke.

                Flow (Water) — During an outage, information is oxygen. Water
                architects refine paging protocols, status channels, and
                stakeholder updates so messages flow calmly, preventing rumor
                floods and allowing engineers to focus attention where telemetry
                says it matters most.

                Risk (Fire) — The Outage itself is pure Fire: scorching,
                immediate, and illuminating. Risk architects channel this flame
                into tabletop drills, chaos experiments, and hardened alert
                rules, using the burn to reveal weak couplings before the next
                spark ignites.

                Change (Air) — After flames subside, Air carries reflection.
                Change architects capture timelines, ship ADRs, and seed
                refactors that transform scars into safeguards. Each
                post-incident learning becomes a breeze that cools hot surfaces
                and reshapes future design.
