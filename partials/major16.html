                The Refactor represents the disciplined art of reshaping a
                living codebase without altering its outward behaviour.
                It honours existing value while carving away duplication,
                tightening cohesion, and revealing clearer intent.
                Architects channel this card when they schedule small, safe
                iterations: green tests, minimal diffs, frequent commits, and
                watchful observability.
                Each cycle lowers cognitive load, shrinks defect surfaces, and
                prepares the soil for future features.
                Like a sculptor revealing form from marble, the refactorer
                removes what is needless so what is essential can flourish.
                Done well, refactoring extends product life, keeps developer
                morale high, and compounds velocity over time.

                Structure (Earth) — View the codebase as layered geology: each
                refactor tidies sedimented strata, restoring clear strata lines
                and sealing cracks that invite coupling. Solid structure
                emerges, making future architectural load-bearing safe and
                predictable.

                Flow (Water) — Smooth refactoring pipelines keep changes
                streaming rather than damming behind fear. Pair reviews, CI
                gates, and incremental pull requests let feedback circulate
                swiftly, preventing stagnation and nurturing a culture of
                constant improvement.

                Risk (Fire) — Untamed code ignites outages; disciplined
                refactors quench latent sparks. By retiring dead branches,
                removing unsafe casts, and adding tests around edge-cases, you
                shrink the tinder that fuels future production fires.

                Change (Air) — Refactoring is the breeze that clears stale air
                from the system. It sweeps away obsolescence, freshens design,
                and makes space for innovation to enter effortlessly, keeping
                the product light, flexible, and ready to soar.
