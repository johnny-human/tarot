                The Prototype represents the architect’s permission to build
                small, disposable artefacts in order to
                learn quickly. It favours evidence over speculation and
                celebrates the insight gained from throwing
                work away. By isolating a narrow hypothesis, we protect the
                production baseline while exposing
                assumptions to real usage. The card reminds us that quality
                comes from iterations, not from a single
                stroke of genius; each throw-away spike is an investment in
                knowledge, not waste. When drawn, it
                challenges the team to time-box experiments, codify findings,
                and decide with data, cutting short the
                endless debate between gut feeling and exhaustive upfront design
                and delivering a clearer architectural
                roadmap.

                Structure (Earth) — From a Structure lens, prototypes sit
                outside the permanent architecture, yet they
                inform it. Carve them into isolated modules, stub dependencies,
                and resist polishing details; their
                value is the structural insight they return, not their code.

                Flow (Water) — Flow-wise, a prototype accelerates communication.
                Stakeholders grasp tangible UI clicks
                faster than slide decks. Share quick demo videos, capture
                feedback instantly, and fold the lessons
                into the backlog before momentum stalls and curiosity fades.

                Risk (Fire) — Risk is contained because the throw-away branch
                shields production. Yet unseen dangers lurk
                if a prototype drifts into prod. Gate it behind flags, limit
                data scope, and destroy the branch on
                decision day to avoid lingering exposure.

                Change (Air) — Change is the card’s native element. A prototype
                embodies flux, embracing uncertainty
                instead of fearing it. Time-boxing forces conclusions; the
                learnings become catalysts, guiding
                refactors or pivots and fueling a continuous evolution mindset
                across the team.
