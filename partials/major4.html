                The Spike represents a deliberate, time-boxed experiment
                executed to de-risk uncertainty in code, tooling, or domain
                knowledge. It is intentionally isolated from production paths,
                favoring throw-away code over polished deliverables so learning
                arrives quickly and cheaply. This card reminds architects to
                prioritise questions over features: build only enough to
                validate an assumption, measure the outcome, and then discard
                the scaffold. When The Spike appears it signals that decisive
                exploration is overdue; lingering ambiguity threatens wise
                decision-making. Its energy is transient yet invaluable during
                architecture evolution. Embrace short, focused bursts of
                investigation, celebrate discoveries, and ruthlessly delete
                temporary artifacts to keep momentum.

                Structure (Earth) — In the realm of structure, a spike carves a
                narrow tunnel through the codebase, touching only what must be
                touched. Its temporary scaffolding respects encapsulation,
                preventing lasting scars while revealing the edges of a future
                module boundary.

                </span>
                Flow (Water) — For process and communication, the spike opens a
                quick feedback channel: decisions are postponed until evidence
                speaks. Pairing, short demos, and concise ADR notes ensure
                stakeholders absorb findings without bogging the team in endless
                debate or status churn.

                Risk (Fire) — From a risk lens, spiking confines uncertainty to
                a controlled blaze. By isolating dangerous experiments behind
                feature flags or throw-away branches, architects extinguish
                hazards before they reach production, transforming unknown
                threats into documented, manageable insights.

                Change (Air) — Spikes are pure change energy—they condense
                possibility into a brief moment, then vanish. Their leftovers
                are lessons, not artifacts, empowering the team to pivot
                designs, refine roadmaps, and advance confidently toward the
                next evolutionary checkpoint.
