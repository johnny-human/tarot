                An Architectural Decision Record (ADR) captures a moment of
                architectural intent, the alternative paths considered, and the
                consequences anticipated, preserving context long after
                whiteboards are wiped. It acts as a lightweight contract between
                past and future engineers, preventing déjà-vu debates and making
                rationale traceable to code. By writing ADRs at the time of
                decision, teams expose hidden assumptions, integrate stakeholder
                voices, and link implementation details to strategic vision. The
                card reminds architects that clarity is currency: capturing even
                imperfect reasoning is better than relying on memory and
                folklore. An ADR is memory, map, and mirror in one concise
                document.

                Structure (Earth) — An ADR anchors design artifacts, giving
                diagrams and code a naming hinge. When the structure drifts, the
                corresponding record flags intent, guiding refactorings back
                toward the agreed domain boundaries without reinventing
                rationale.

                Flow (Water) — Writing ADRs norms conversational flow: propose,
                debate, decide, document. The ritual turns heated meetings into
                paced currents, letting knowledge glide downstream to new hires
                and upstream to sponsors who crave assurance of thoughtful
                governance.

                </span>
                Risk (Fire) — Each record extinguishes uncertainty by capturing
                trade-offs and fallout, but also exposes combustible corners.
                Reading a chain of ADRs reveals patterns of risky bias,
                prompting proactive security reviews before the spark jumps into
                production.

                </span>
                Change (Air) — When requirements shift, an ADR becomes a pivot
                note: supersede, not erase. This living lineage of decisions
                allows architecture to evolve transparently, acknowledging past
                wisdom while inviting future adaptability without losing
                narrative continuity.
