                Threat modeling brings the unseen dangers of a system into plain
                sight. By cataloging assets, actors, and attack paths,
                architects convert vague anxieties into actionable design
                constraints. The exercise forces clarity: boundaries sharpen,
                data flows emerge, and hidden assumptions surface for
                inspection. With prioritized mitigations, teams shift security
                from after-thought to continuous discipline. Revisiting the
                model each iteration keeps pace with changing features and
                dependencies, ensuring defenses evolve alongside functionality.
                Done well, it produces shared diagrams, ranked risks, and clear
                owners—turning abstract fear into a living contract between
                architectural ambition and operational safety.

                <strong>XVIII The Risk</strong> — This card magnifies
                uncertainty, urging architects to confront exposure head-on.
                Paired with Threat Modeling, it transforms raw anxiety into
                structured vigilance: see the flames before they spark, and
                design escape routes that turn looming catastrophe into
                controlled challenge.

                <strong>XV The Outage</strong> — Speaking from the 3 a.m. pager
                wake-up, it shows the cost of blind spots. Together, these cards
                form a loop: envision the breach, prevent the call, and harvest
                lessons when prevention fails, hardening the system for the next
                cycle.
