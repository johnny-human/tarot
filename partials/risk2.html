                An incident review is the structured reflection that transforms
                failures into fuel for resilience. Conducted soon after an
                outage, it reconstructs the timeline, surfaces contributing
                factors, and highlights latent weaknesses in process or code.
                The session is explicitly blameless, focusing on system
                conditions rather than individual mistakes, so psychological
                safety remains intact and insights flow freely. Action items are
                made visible, assigned owners, and tracked to closure, ensuring
                lessons convert to concrete change. Over time, consistent
                reviews create an organisational memory that shortens recovery,
                strengthens design decisions, and gradually embeds a culture
                where risk is accepted as information rather than fear.

                <strong>The Outage</strong> — The Outage reminds us why the
                review exists: a sudden blaze that exposed hidden tinder. Its
                fiery lesson pushes the team to examine systemic weak spots,
                document signals missed, and harden alerts so the next spark
                finds less fuel to burn.

                turns fleeting verbal insight into durable organisational
                memory. By capturing root causes, corrective tasks, and context,
                it prevents déjà-vu incidents and gives new hires a map of past
                pitfalls, turning yesterday’s pain into tomorrow’s prevention
                guide.
