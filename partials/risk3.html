            <p><strong>Theme (quick cue):</strong><br> Reliability targets,
                error budgets</p>
        </div>

        <div class="principle">
            <p>Service Level Agreements (SLAs) and Service Level Objectives
                (SLOs) transform vague reliability expectations into explicit,
                numeric commitments. By defining error budgets and latency
                ceilings, architects anchor engineering choices in customer
                impact: every backlog item, deployment, and rollback must
                respect the agreed allowance. Healthy SLOs act as guardrails,
                pausing feature work when burn rates spike and granting creative
                freedom when budgets are healthy. They foster shared visibility
                across product, operations, and leadership, replacing gut feel
                with actionable telemetry. When revisited regularly, these
                targets evolve with usage patterns, preventing both
                over-engineering and complacency. Without them, risk
                conversations drift and accountability blurs. Ultimately, clear
                SLAs and SLOs transform uptime from guesswork into
                governance.</p>

                <strong>XV The Outage</strong> — When XV The Outage appears
                beside this card, it warns that numbers alone cannot prevent
                failure. Use the error budget as a siren: when it hits zero,
                declare incident readiness, rehearse runbooks, and treat the
                deficit as technical debt due now.

                <strong>XIII The Governance</strong> — Drawn with XIII The
                Governance, SLAs and SLOs become policy levers. Publish targets
                in executable contracts, tie release gates to budget burn, and
                let automated dashboards conduct the orchestra of compliance.
                Good governance turns reliability metrics into a shared,
                enterprise-wide language of accountability.
