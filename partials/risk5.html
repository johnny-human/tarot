            <p>
                A Zero-Day is a flaw no one planned for yet every attacker
                covets. Architecture that respects this card assumes breach:
                bill-of-materials scans run nightly, dependencies stay pinned,
                and rollback scripts wait in the wings. When advisory sirens
                sound, automated pipelines slice approval queues, canary
                clusters soak-test patched images, and feature flags darken
                risky paths without human hesitation. Communication is as vital
                as code; incident channels light up with clear roles, and a
                single commander tracks blast radius, customer impact, and legal
                notice windows. Success is measured by how briefly the window
                stays open—and how calmly the team closes it.

                <strong>The Outage</strong> — This card reminds us that a
                Zero-Day unpatched is already an outage in waiting. Reading them
                together urges architects to rehearse the fire drill today, so
                tomorrow’s pager buzz feels like choreography rather than chaos.

                <strong>The Refactor</strong> — Pairing with the Refactor
                reframes the fix as more than a hot patch. It is a chance to
                excise brittle code, upgrade libraries, and harden boundaries,
                turning emergency toil into lasting design improvement.
