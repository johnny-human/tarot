            <p>
                Overengineering happens when elegance gives way to
                elaboration—layers, frameworks, and abstractions
                appear “just in case” rather than “just in time.” Each extra
                knob widens the blast-radius,
                slows onboarding, and bloats cognitive load. The architect’s
                discipline is to ask
                <em>“Which risk am I really buying down?”</em> and to pay only
                that premium. By favouring
                clear language, observable constraints, and reversible steps,
                you create systems that can
                grow organically instead of fossilising in prematurely
                sophisticated scaffolding. Simplicity
                is not laziness; it is strategic reserve for the problems that
                truly earn complexity.

                the storm; disruptive change
                exposes how excess layers block pivot speed. This card reminds
                you that innovation favours
                nimble structures and punishes baroque fortresses.

                <strong>VII · The Monolith</strong> —The monolith’s mass warns
                that building too much into one
                shape can freeze evolution. Overengineering often hides inside a
                single powerful core that
                later resists the very flexibility it promised to enable.
