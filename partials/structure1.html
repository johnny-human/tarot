            <p>
                Encapsulation is the discipline of hiding implementation detail
                behind a stable, minimal interface. By exposing only what
                callers truly need, a component keeps its internal data,
                algorithms, and side-effects private. This secrecy makes change
                cheap: internal refactors never ripple outward, and dependents
                remain safe from accidental coupling. Effective encapsulation
                demands crisp names, strict access controls, thorough tests, and
                documentation that records promises—not mechanics. When
                practiced consistently across modules, services, and layers, the
                entire system gains modularity, parallel-development velocity,
                and a natural defence against regressions. Encapsulation is
                therefore the bedrock on which sustainable architecture is
                built.

                <strong>XIV The Container</strong> — A well-defined boundary,
                like a
                Docker
                image, wraps code, libraries, and configuration into a
                predictable box. Pairing Container with Encapsulation stresses
                runtime isolation: when internals are sealed, deployment and
                scaling become repeatable and safe.

                <strong>I The Architect</strong> — This card embodies the act of
                defining crisp
                boundaries before a single line of code is written. It urges
                teams to model responsibilities up front, so each module owns
                one purpose and later changes never threaten the broader
                architectural vision.
