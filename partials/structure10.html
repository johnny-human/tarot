            <p><strong>Theme (quick cue):</strong><br>
                Ports & adapters isolate domain logic
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="principle">
            <p>
                Hexagonal Architecture seats pure business rules at the centre
                and surrounds them with “ports” that declare
                everything the core needs from the outside world. Concrete
                technologies—databases, message buses, UIs, vendor
                APIs—arrive later as “adapters” that plug into those ports
                without poking holes in the domain. The pattern
                invites fast, in-memory testing, easy tech swaps, and parallel
                team work: one squad can craft adapters while
                another evolves the core without merge-storm collisions. By
                inverting dependencies, it shrinks blast radius,
                clarifies ownership, and lets the code express business truth
                instead of framework trivia—ideal for evolving
                products and regulated systems alike.

                <strong>The Container</strong> — Like a well-built container
                image, hexagonal boundaries package the domain,
                promise reproducibility, and keep noisy neighbours out. They
                remind us that runtime details may change, but a
                sealed contract preserves portability and trust across every
                cluster we deploy.

                </span><strong>The Architect</strong> — This card asks: have you
                drawn ports that mirror the business language
                or the framework manual? True vision balances clarity with
                flexibility, ensuring adapters serve strategy rather
                than dictating it. The Architect blesses designs where policy
                never leaks protocol.
