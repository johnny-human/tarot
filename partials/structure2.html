            <p><strong>Theme (quick cue):</strong><br> Cohesive slices, clear

        <div class="principle">
            <p>
                Modularity teaches that a healthy system is a federation of
                clear, cohesive parts rather than an undifferentiated mass. Each
                module gathers closely related responsibilities behind a crisp
                interface, hiding internal choices so other parts depend only on
                stable contracts. This separation limits change ripple, enables
                parallel work, and allows independent scaling or replacement.
                Good modularity balances granularity: slices that are too fine
                bring orchestration overhead, too coarse breeds tangled
                coupling. The architect enforces boundaries with naming,
                directory layout, service repos, and automated tests that police
                API drift. Effective modularity also encourages team ownership,
                because code and people structures mirror each other.

                <strong>The Architect</strong> — Like The Architect, Modularity
                begins with a mental map of purpose and proportion. The card
                reminds you to sketch boundaries first, letting vision dictate
                slices before code appears. When modules reflect the system’s
                story, communication costs drop and long-term clarity endures.

                <strong>The Refactor</strong> — The Refactor speaks to
                modularity’s ongoing upkeep. Boundaries drift as features grow;
                this major urges regular pruning, merging, or splitting modules
                so shape matches reality. Continuous refactoring keeps
                interfaces honest and prevents the slow slide back into
                monolithic inertia.
