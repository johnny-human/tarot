                Coupling measures how tightly one component depends on another,
                dictating how painlessly the system can evolve. Healthy
                architecture minimises direct knowledge of concrete
                implementations, instead trading through stable interfaces,
                message queues, or events. By mapping dependency graphs,
                enforcing inversion of control, and avoiding cyclical
                references, you keep change localized and regression risk low.
                Loose coupling lets teams deploy independently, test in
                isolation, and replace modules without ripple effects; tight
                coupling, by contrast, amplifies every tweak into a coordinated
                release and slows innovation. Continuously examining integration
                points and refactoring toward seams keeps the codebase supple
                under growth and shifting requirements today.

                <strong>VII The Monolith</strong> — Evoke The Monolith when
                coupling grows unchecked; its massive, unified core warns that
                convenience often hides future inertia. The card urges you to
                weigh the security of a single source of truth against the
                bottleneck of synchronized releases and the fear of widespread
                failure.

                <strong>XVI The Refactor</strong> — Invoke The Refactor as a
                remedy: it champions incremental decoupling, interface
                extraction, and test-guided change. Drawing this card signals
                momentum for slicing dependencies, embracing adapters, and
                restoring autonomy so separate modules can evolve, scale, and
                even be replaced without a high-stakes rewrite.
