                Cohesion asks every class, function, or bounded context to tell
                a single clear story. When related
                responsibilities sit together, the codebase feels like a
                well-edited book: each chapter flows
                logically, intent is obvious, and change ripples stay inside a
                tight circle. High cohesion reduces
                cognitive load for newcomers, flattens defect-finding time, and
                supports parallel work because
                teams rarely step on each other’s toes. Low cohesion, by
                contrast, scatters concepts across files
                and layers, forcing developers to hop back and forth to
                understand even a minor tweak. Pursuing
                cohesion therefore multiplies velocity while quietly raising
                quality and morale.

                <strong>The Architect</strong> — Cohesion embodies the
                Architect’s quest for structural clarity: every
                element must sit where its intent is obvious. When you inspect a
                cohesive module, you glimpse the
                Architect’s blueprint made real, and design discussions shift
                from “where does this live?” to
                “does this belong at all?”.

                <strong>The Refactor</strong> — Cohesion fuels effective
                refactoring: tighter units mean smaller,
                safer cuts and quicker feedback. The Refactor card reminds us
                that revisiting code is painless
                when concepts are already clustered; splitting tangled duties
                then feels less like surgery and
                more like tidying a well-labeled workshop.
