        <div class="principle">
            <p>
                Layering places each responsibility in its proper stratum so
                information flows downward and policy
                bubbles upward without shortcut tunnels. Presentation speaks to
                application services, which consult domain
                logic, which delegate persistence to infrastructure. Clear entry
                points let you swap databases, refactor UI
                frameworks, or introduce new interfaces without open-heart
                surgery on the core. Explicit boundaries shrink
                cognitive load, enable parallel work, and provide natural seams
                for automated testing, security controls,
                and deployment pipelines. When a layer breaks its contract,
                ripple effects are obvious and repairable. Good
                layering curbs accidental coupling while still allowing
                just-enough communication through well-designed
                ports and adapters.

                <strong>The Architect</strong> — With Layering, The Architect
                surveys the elevation plan, ensuring each
                tier expresses a single concern and no beam bears hidden weight.
                Vision and balance turn the stack into a
                cathedral, not a tower of patch cords, guiding newcomers up
                orderly flights of abstraction.

                </span><strong>The Governance</strong> — Layer boundaries are
                the guardrails of The Governance, converting
                policy into code by forbidding sideways calls and backdoor data
                leaks. Standards for crossing
                layers—DTOs, APIs, events—make compliance auditable and change
                approvals quick, proving that freedom thrives
                within clear, enforceable borders.
