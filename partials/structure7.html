                Design patterns give engineers a shared language to describe
                proven solutions to recurring design
                challenges. By naming structures like Strategy, Observer, or
                Adapter, they compress complex intent
                into a single, well-understood term, shrinking explanations and
                review time. Patterns also highlight
                trade-offs, steering conversations toward behaviour and
                variability instead of low-level code. Used
                judiciously, they impose just enough structure to keep code
                extensible while avoiding over-engineering.
                The architect’s job is to select patterns that fit the domain,
                document their rationale, and enforce
                consistency across modules. When each pattern is clearly
                recognised, collaboration accelerates,
                onboarding shortens, and future refactors proceed with
                confidence.

                <strong>The Architect</strong> — As The Architect oversees the
                system’s blueprint, Design Patterns
                become their shorthand wiring diagram. Drawing this card beside
                Patterns reminds the team to balance
                elegance and practicality, ensuring every chosen idiom serves
                the wider vision rather than mere
                intellectual curiosity.

                <strong>The Refactor</strong> — The Refactor appears when
                structures drift from intent. Paired with
                Design Patterns, it urges pruning ceremonial layers, restoring
                pattern purity, and verifying tests
                still guard contracts. Together they signal evolution: keep the
                vocabulary, renew the code, and drop
                abstractions that no longer earn their keep.
